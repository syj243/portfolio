			<p>Hi! My name is So Yun Jin and I am a student at the University of Michigan School of Information studying User Experience Design. I am passionate about creating beautiful and intuitive designs and implementing them through code. I hope to work as a user experience designer or a front-end-developer in the technology sector upon graduation. <br/><br/>

			I'm from Korea, but I spent more than half of my life abroad. I lived in three different countries before coming to the US, Korea, Chile and Colombia, and traveled to many more. Raised in a Korean household in a western environment, I learned to embrace the culture of both worlds. I love exploring new places and meeting new people. Traveling and taking pictures of the different places I visit are my favorite things to do!</p>
